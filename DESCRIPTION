Description: For testing the homogeneity of effects of both the row and columns factors against their simultaneous ordered alternatives in a two-way crossed ANOVA model the test statistics R_1, R_2 and R_3 are proposed. This package includes two functions R_1 and R_2_R_3. The function R_1 gives the observed, critical and P-value of the test statistic R_1 and the function R_2_3 gives the observed, critical and P-values of the test statistics R_2 and R_3.
